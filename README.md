# Quantitative-Finance-ML-Model

Advanced machine learning techniques applied to predict CSI 800 stock returns, identify orthogonal alphas, and develop strategies to outperform market benchmarks in the Chinese A-share stock market.

# Orthogonal Alphas Stock Prediction

In collaboration with Optimas Capital, this applied business project harnessed Random Forest and XGBoost models, targeting orthogonal alphas—unique risk-adjusted returns independent of standard market movements—to construct effective trading strategies leveraging large datasets with over 2000 financial features.


## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop predictive models for the CSI 800 index to forecast stock returns and unearth orthogonal alphas, aiming for robust, uncorrelated trading strategies.
**Methodology**: Employed data preprocessing, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Information Coefficient (IC) scores for feature selection. Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost models, rigorously evaluated via backtesting.
**Results**: Strategically achieved orthogonal alphas with a correlation under 0.05 and produced strategies yielding a 17.81% alpha, indicating significant outperformance over the CSI 300 benchmark.


## Repository Structure

- `/notebooks`: Illustrative Jupyter notebooks of the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation phases, with sensitive information excluded for confidentiality.
- `/doc`: This directory contains additional documentation that elaborates on project insights and findings. Included are generalized project reports that detail the methodologies employed, the data preprocessing steps taken, and the results achieved.. While the documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the project's approach to predicting stock returns and identifying orthogonal alphas, it remains within the bounds of confidentiality agreements and does not disclose proprietary data.



## Getting Started
Due to NDA restrictions, the specific dataset used in this project is not shared. Nevertheless, the methodologies outlined are applicable to similar financial datasets. The required Python environment includes libraries such as scikit-learn, xgboost, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, ensuring replicability of the project analysis.


## Key Findings

- **Data Preprocessing**: By employing PCA, we managed a substantial feature set effectively, maintaining essential variability for model training.
- **Model Comparison**: The XGBoost model demonstrated its prowess by achieving higher strategy alpha, underscoring its utility in top-tier stock selection for investment strategies.
- **Strategy Evaluation**: Robust backtesting validated the predictive models, revealing strategies that substantially outperform the CSI 300 benchmark, attesting to the models' ability to manage volatility and leverage market complexities.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the potential of machine learning in quantitative finance. Our approach, from rigorous data preprocessing to strategic model application, underscores the importance of sophisticated algorithms in identifying profitable trading opportunities.
