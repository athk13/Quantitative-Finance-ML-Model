# Project Overview

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Quantitative Finance ML Model project, detailing the objectives, scope, and methodologies applied in the development of machine learning models to predict stock returns and identify orthogonal alphas in the Chinese stock market.

## Objectives
The primary aim of this project was to:
- Develop predictive models for stock returns of the CSI 800 index.
- Implement advanced data preprocessing techniques to refine the dataset.
- Employ machine learning algorithms to uncover investment strategies that outperform market benchmarks.

## Scope
This project encompasses the period from "2008-01-31 to 2022-12-30, analyzing a vast array of financial features while adhering to strict confidentiality and data privacy standards as per the NDA agreement.

## Methodologies
A brief outline of the methodologies used, which includes:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction.
- Information Coefficient (IC) scores for feature selection.
- Random Forest and XGBoost models for prediction.
- Backtesting strategies to evaluate model performance.
