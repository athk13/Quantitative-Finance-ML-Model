# Project Overview

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Quantitative Finance ML Model project, detailing the objectives, scope, and methodologies applied in the development of machine learning models to predict stock returns and identify orthogonal alphas in the Chinese stock market.

## Objectives
The primary aim of this project was to:
- Develop predictive models for stock returns of the CSI 800 index.
- Predict future stock returns with a high degree of accuracy.
- Discover orthogonal alphas with low correlation to common market factors.
- Develop and validate trading strategies that consistently outperform the CSI 300 benchmark.

## Scope
Spanning from January 2008 to December 2022, the project encompasses a dataset with over 2000 financial features derived from CSI 800 stock information, scrutinized under stringent data privacy standards.

## Methodologies
A brief outline of the methodologies used, which includes:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction.
- Information Coefficient (IC) scores for feature selection.
- Random Forest and XGBoost models for prediction.
- Backtesting strategies to evaluate model performance.
