# Results

## Performance Overview
Our strategies, powered by XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms, delivered compelling results:
- Alpha generation was a key performance indicator, with our models reaching an alpha of up to 17.81%.
- Sharpe ratios of our strategies peaked at 0.73, suggesting strong risk-adjusted returns.

## Detailed Findings
- Backtesting results showed our top-performing model achieving an impressive 606.24% cumulative return over the test period.
- Volatility was well-managed, with the most successful model having an annualized volatility of 23.08%.

## Conclusions
The strategic application of machine learning models yielded significant excess returns, demonstrating the potential of advanced analytical techniques in financial markets.
